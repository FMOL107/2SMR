        <h1>Welcome to myPod</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might 
            be. Wanna join the fun? All you need is any iPod, from the early 
            classic iPod to the latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to 
            the largest iPod Photo, and a digital camera. Just take a snapshot 
            of your iPod in your favorite location and we'll be glad to post it on 
            myPod. So, what are you waiting for?
        </p>

            Me and my iPod in Seattle! You can see rain clouds and the Space 
            Needle. You can't see the 628 coffee shops.
