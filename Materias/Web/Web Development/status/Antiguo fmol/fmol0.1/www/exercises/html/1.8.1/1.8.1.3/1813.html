            Windows Defender was recently boosted by an industry-respected 
            AV Test report that gave it a perfect rating alongside F-Secure 
            Safe 17 and Norton Security 22 for home antivirus protection. 
            The differentiator is that Windows Defender is a free solution 
            that comes installed as part of Windows 10. This was excellent 
            news for both Microsoft, which has been working hard to make 
            Defender a top-notch security offering, and users who can get 
            the best protection out there without splashing the cash. 
            Until that is, Microsoft went and broke it with an update. 
            How did Microsoft break Windows Defender?
            
            To resolve a coding flaw in the Windows System File Checker 
            (SFC) that caused an error when checking for system files that 
            needed repair, Microsoft released an update to Windows Defender 
            on September 16. That fix, Windows Defender version 4.18.1908.7, 
            unfortunately introduced another, just as serious, scanning 
            problem: both quick and full scans stopped working after 
            inspecting only a handful of files.
            
            I confirmed this myself by running a full Windows Defender 
            scan which, instead of taking up to an hour to complete, 
            took a few seconds and reported it had only scanned ten files.
            
            A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the issue and said: 
            "Only manual or scheduled scans conducted by administrators 
            were temporarily impacted and we are working to resolve it."
            
            This issue is very concerning from a security perspective; 
            users need to have trust in the security solution they are 
            using and updates that break things also break this trust, 
            or at least erode it. However, it should be pointed out 
            that the real-time scanning of endpoints wasn't impacted 
            by the update, and users could still use the custom scanning 
            feature which continued to work as intended.

            Today In: Innovation

            What should you do now?
            
            The good news is that Microsoft has already confirmed it 
            has fixed the problem, almost as quickly as it created it, 
            with another update. The fix can be found in a security 
            intelligence update for Windows Defender antivirus. This 
            should automatically update your Windows Defender definitions 
            and resolve the scanning issue. To be sure, however, it is 
            recommended that you check for updates in the Windows Security 
            Virus & Threat Protection screen to trigger a download of 
            the latest version.

            PROMOTED
            What you shouldn't do now
            
            It's essential to keep things in perspective here, 
            which means not jumping to a knee-jerk conclusion that 
            Windows Updates are allbad and should, therefore, be 
            ignored where at all possible. Certainly when it comes 
            to the security side of the updates fence, and that's 
            where I firmly stand, not updating is poor logic. 
            Security updates do make your systems more secure, 
            and even though they do go wrong now and then the vast 
            majority are seamless improvements to the security 
            posture of your machine. By not updating you are leaving 
            yourself open to a much higher risk of something going 
            seriously wrong, such as a breach or other compromise 
            than updating exposes you to.
            
            Perhaps I should have added a "What Microsoft should do now" 
            heading, with the advice that it needs to get on top of these 
            update issues before user trust in them is diminished to the 
            point of no return. I appreciate it's a challenging and 
            complicated process, but an organization the size of 
            Microsoft with all those years of experience really should 
            do better.

            (CNN)"What happened to Jesse?"
            That's the question that "Breaking Bad" creator Vince 
            Gilligan told The Hollywood Reporter put him on the 
            path to his latest project. "El Camino: A Breaking 
            Bad Movie" is set to premiere October 11 on Netflix 
            and in theaters in 68 cities before it airs on the 
            original show's home network of AMC early next year.

            Gilligan told THR he felt there was more story to 
            tell after his hit series starring Bryan Cranston 
            as teacher-turned-drug-dealer Walter White and Aaron 
            Paul as his right hand man, Jesse Pinkman, ended 
            following five seasons in 2013. He was especially 
            intrigued by the thought of what happened with Paul's 
            character, Jesse. "You see him driving away. 
            And to my mind, he went off to a happy ending," 
            Gilligan said. "But as the years progressed, I thought, 
            'What did that ending - let's just call it an ending, 
            neither happy, nor sad - what did it look like?'
            "For his part, Paul said he was good after the 
            finale aired. "I really loved Jesse," the actor said. 
            "I knew him better than anyone, but it was a big weight 
            off of my shoulders to hang up the cleats and walk away. 
            I thought it was goodbye, and I was OK with that." 
            Like many others Paul thought the ending of the series was
             perfect, so "why mess with that?"But his loyalty to Gilligan 
             ("I would follow Vince into a fire") helped draw him back 
             Paul told the publication. "It was so easy for me to just 
             jump into where Jesse's at mentally, emotionally, 
             because I lived and breathed everything he went 
             through and then some, and so, honestly, it felt 
             like a part of me had gone through that as well," 
             Paul said. "All I had to do was just memorize these 
             words and then play them out when they yelled 'action.' 
             " Gilligan has a warning for newbie's to the show,: 
             "If, after 12 years, you haven't watched 'Breaking Bad,' 
             you're probably not going to start now."

            "If you do, I hope that this movie would still be 
            engaging on some level, but there's no doubt in my 
            mind that you won't get as much enjoyment out of it," 
            he said. "We don't slow down to explain things to a 
            non-'Breaking Bad' audience. I thought early on in the 
            writing of the script, 'Maybe there's a way to have my 
            cake and eat it too. Maybe there's a way to explain 
            things to the audience.' If there was a way to do that, 
            it eluded me."

            It took a significant location tracking scandal for Google 
            to actually do something about the user's privacy when it 
            comes to location tracking. After a report called Google 
            out for misleading users who thought their location data 
            wouldn't be collected because of the way they set up 
            location permissions, Google came up with fixes. 
            Now you can stop Google from tracking you, except 
            for those apps where location data is paramount - think 
            Google Maps and Waze. Also, Google added better privacy 
            features in Android 10, which deal with location data as 
            well - freaking out Facebook in the process. On top of 
            that, Google is about to make Google Maps even more private, 
            if that's something you want from the app. The company 
            is bringing Incognito Mode to Google Maps, and the feature 
            is already in testing.

            Don't Miss
            How is this $37 hidden spy camera on Amazon even legal?
            
            One way to use Google Maps and try to limit the location 
            data it collects is by actually signing out of your Google 
            account. But that's hardly convenient, and that's where 
            Incognito Mode will come in handy. You'll be able to 
            turn the feature on, just like you might do it for 
            Chrome or YouTube, to avoid your searches or navigation 
            data to be associated with your primary Google account.
            
            The feature was promised some four months ago at 
            Google I/O, so we knew it was already in the works, 
            but Android Police reports that it's only now 
            rolling out to some members of the Google Maps Preview test.
            
            Incognito Mode will work everywhere Google Maps is 
            available, including Android Auto. The image below 
            shows the mode activated in the car. You'll notice 
            the black status bar which reads "Incognito Mode is on.
            
            Image Source: Android Police
            
            The following animation shows how switching to 
            Incognito Mode works on an Android phone. You 
            just have to select the option from your Google 
            account avatar, at which point a black status bar 
            will inform you that you're using the app incognito. 
            Also, the locator marker will change from blue to dark 
            to mark the change. You'll be able to switch back to the 
            regular Maps experience whenever you feel like it.
            
            To get the feature right now, you'll need to have 
            Preview Maps version 10.26 or later installed. 
            That is if you're part of the Preview Maps test 
            group. Otherwise, you'll have to wait a while for 
            Google to release it more broadly
